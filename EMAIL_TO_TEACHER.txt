Subject: Web Development 1 - Project Proposal: SquadSport Platform

Dear M. de Haan / Dan Breczinski,

I am writing to submit my project proposal for the Web Development 1 course (Term 2.2). I apologize for the delayed submission - this should have been submitted earlier in the project timeline.

PROJECT TITLE: SquadSport - Sports Match Management Platform

USE CASE:
SquadSport is a web application that helps sports enthusiasts in Amsterdam discover and join pick-up games, track their performance, and participate in organized tournaments. The platform addresses the real problem of fragmented sports organization across social media and messaging apps by providing a centralized, easy-to-use solution.

TARGET USERS:
- Primary: Sports players looking for games and tracking their history
- Secondary: Organizers/admins managing matches, tournaments, and events

MAIN FEATURES:

User Features:
• User registration and authentication with secure login
• Browse and filter matches by sport, location, and date (with AJAX)
• Join/leave matches with real-time updates
• Track match history with win/loss records
• Manage profile with sports skill levels (1-5 rating per sport)

Admin Features:
• Dashboard with statistics (users, matches, tournaments)
• Full CRUD operations for matches, sports, locations, tournaments, events
• Participant management and result approval
• Real-time updates using AJAX

API Features:
• Public JSON endpoints for today's matches and upcoming tournaments
• Authenticated endpoints for match participation
• Ready for potential mobile app integration

TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION:

Technologies:
• Backend: PHP 8+ with PDO, MariaDB database
• Frontend: HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap 5.3.3, Vanilla JavaScript
• Infrastructure: Docker (NGINX, PHP-FPM, MariaDB)
• Architecture: Custom MVC pattern with routing system

Security Features:
• CSRF protection on all forms and AJAX requests
• SQL injection prevention (PDO prepared statements)
• XSS prevention (output sanitization with htmlspecialchars)
• Password hashing with bcrypt
• Input validation (email, required fields, type checking)
• Route protection with authentication and authorization

Database:
• 9 tables: users, matches, match_participants, sports, locations, tournaments, tournament_rounds, user_sports, events
• Proper relationships with foreign keys
• Optimized queries with JOINs

COURSE REQUIREMENTS COVERAGE:

✅ Authentic Use Case: Real-world sports community platform
✅ CSS: Bootstrap 5 + custom responsive design with transitions
✅ Sessions: User authentication and flash messaging
✅ Security: CSRF, XSS, SQL injection prevention, password hashing
✅ MVC: 9 controllers, 10 models, organized views, custom routing
✅ API: Public JSON endpoints + authenticated endpoints
✅ JavaScript: AJAX for filtering and real-time match join/leave
✅ Legal/Accessibility: WCAG 2.1 Level AA compliance + GDPR documentation

UNIQUE FEATURES:

• Real-time match filtering without page refresh
• Automatic match capacity management (open → full status)
• Skill-based user profiles (foundation for future matching)
• Admin result approval system with AJAX
• Legacy password migration (MySQL PASSWORD() → bcrypt)
• Comprehensive API documentation

DELIVERABLES:

• GitHub Repository: https://github.com/Sukharev-ukr/webdev11
• Comprehensive README with full documentation (17KB)
• All security features documented with code references
• WCAG compliance documented with implementation details
• GDPR compliance statement with data protection measures
• Complete API documentation with request/response examples
• Dockerized environment for easy setup

LEARNING OBJECTIVES ACHIEVED:

Through this project, I have:
• Implemented proper MVC architecture with separation of concerns
• Mastered secure database integration with PDO
• Applied security best practices (CSRF, XSS, SQL injection prevention)
• Created RESTful JSON APIs
• Built interactive UIs with AJAX
• Understood WCAG accessibility and GDPR requirements

PROJECT STATUS:
The project is fully implemented and documented. All features are functional, security measures are in place, and the application is ready for evaluation.

DOCUMENTATION:
A detailed project proposal document (PROJECT_PROPOSAL.md) is included in the repository with:
• Complete feature breakdown
• Technical architecture details
• Timeline and development phases
• Success criteria and deliverables

I am confident this project meets all course requirements and demonstrates proficiency in web development fundamentals. I look forward to your feedback and am available to discuss or demonstrate any aspect of the implementation.

Please let me know if you need any additional information or clarification.
